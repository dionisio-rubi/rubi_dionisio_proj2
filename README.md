# CS 219 Project 2 #
Created by Rubi Dionisio

## Contains ##
* This program contains the following files:
    * main.cpp
    * CMDHex.cpp
    * CMDHex.h
    * FileManager.cpp
    * FileManager.h
    * makefile



## How to Use ##
* To compile simply type "make".
* Once code has compiled type "./proj2" to see the output in the terminal.

## Key Notes ##
* Makefile provided for this assignment did not work completely for this program, so I redid the makefile in a different way that works as long as directions are followed.
* Within the code, there are comments as to how it works more detailed.
* There is only one class (CMDHex) that has all the computations for each of the operations depending on the keyword, the coorespinding function will be called within that class that cooresponds to the specific operation needed.
