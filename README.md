    * XORHex.cpp         XORHex.h
    * FileManager.cpp   FileManager.h
    * makefile



## How to Use ##
* To compile simply type "make".
* Once code has compiled type "./proj2" to see the output in the terminal.
* Key Note: makefile provided for this assignment did not work completely for this program, so I redid the makefile in a different way that works as long as directions are followed.
* Within the code, there are comments as to how it works more detailed.
