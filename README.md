## Contains ##
* This program contains the following files:
    * main.cpp
    * AddingHex.cpp
    * AddingHex.h
    * FileManager.cpp
    * FileManager.h
    * makefile

## How to Use ##
* To compile simply type "make".
* Once code has compiled type "./proj1" to see the output in the terminal.
* Key Note: makefile provided for this assignment did not work completely for this program, so I redid the makefile in a different way that works as long as directions are followed.
* Within the code, there are comments as to how it works more detailed.

## Findings ##
* The first operation is correct and there is no carry.
* The second operation is also correct and there is no carry.
* The third operation contains a carry which is why the result is 0.
* The fourth operation is correct and does not contain a carry.
* The final operaion is correct and does not contain a carry.
